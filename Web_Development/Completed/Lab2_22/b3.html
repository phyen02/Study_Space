                    <p>Under most conditions, apple trees will set more fruit than needed for a full crop Most apple cultivars wil retain this heavy set of fruit throughout the growing season resulting in small, poorly colored, low quality fruit. Thinning
                        is the removal of the portion of the crop before it matures on the tree to increase the marketability of the remaining fruit and to reduce biennial bearing tendency of the tree.
